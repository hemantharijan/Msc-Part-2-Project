0, I've had my Beetle Convertible for over 4.5 years andhave been overall happy with the car. It is a compact convertible.Don't expect a big trunk or having tall people in the back seat.
1, We bought the car new in 2007 and are generally satisfied. Mechanically the car has been good but build quality needs improvement except for the paint job which is the best I have ever seen.  Problems we have had are: 1. Three headlight bulbs replaced. 2. Entire locking mechanism for power convertible top had to be replaced. 3. Coolant temperature switch replaced. 4. Four trunk pistons failed with the fifth now broken. 5. Seat belt retainer bezel broken off and replaced.  Fuel mileage is average that is 25 around town - less if air running and about 30 mpg at 65 mph if air not running.  Trunk space is inadequate and simple repair under the hood is difficult and expensive.
2," I adore my New Beetle. Even though I'm a male, I get compliments from my other guy friends, especially after they've driven it. Convertible a must! The only problem I've had was the wiring harness shorted. Fortunately, the car is still under warranty, and will be back to running soon!"
3," My wife chose this car to replace a Sebring convertible.  Wanted a clutch again before we got too old.  Performance is adequate at best; acceleration reminds me of my old bugs of my youth.  Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars.  Great head and leg room (I'm six-two).  Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring).  Heated seats (with five settings) are great!  Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration.  Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car.  Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter.  Trunk holds a lot but small opening.  I like the car but glad we lease."
4," 4 of us carpool 1 way 30 min.  Backseat ok for normal size.  Gas mileage could be better but luv, luv my dream car.  Someone is always commenting about it as I did for many years b4 I bought it. Coworkers are happy I finally bought it because they were probably tired of me talking about it for about 5 yrs. I don't have a garage, unfortunately, but it is great in the snow.  Haven't had any problems to date.  Love to go riding on beautiful days with the top down."
5," I owned a 2002 SLK and 2003 BMW Z-4.  After spending a fortune for upkeep of these two cars I dumped them both and bought a 2007 Convertible, and a 2008 Triple White coupe.  They both run circles around my former car.  I have homes in both Sacramento and Palm Springs, a ride of 500 miles.  Both cars get me there in style and comfort.  So far, I have been happy with both.  The comfort level and handling has been outstanding.  Love the fact that I am putting regular gas in and not the premium I was so use to.  I will never do the luxury car route again when I can get a better car in the New Bug."
6," Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!"
7," The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather.  It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler.  It really makes my wife happy and I like that.  The problem is that the windows have to open (when the handle is pulled) to open the door.  If it gets below 20 degrees, the windows won't open. That means that you can't get in, and if you finally do, you can't close the door or the glass will break. Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one."
8," I love my car.  I previously owned an Explorer, and the two are difficult to compare.  The only thing I miss about my Explorer is the storage space, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much can fit in a Beetle.  I don't understand why people complain about the gas mileage, I think it's great but then my Explorer did have a V8 engine.  Beetles are fun cars to drive, the sound system is great, and it works perfectly as a commuter car."
9," My 2005 was so good, I had to have the Triple white special edition.  I wanted white in 2004 when I bought the first one, now I am complete.  Great performance and always a compliment from passers-by."
10," I have had the Beetle convertible for about 1 year (not driving it in the winter months).  I totally love it.  It is fun, reliable and has enough pep for me.  I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk, as I expected virtually nothing.  Just really really pleased. I do miss a change holder, as there is no easy place to put a few dollars."
11," I have the 5-speed, and do enjoy the car's drive and handling.  150HP is plenty in car this size, and I have no complaints about acceleration (Go Bug, Go!).  The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well.  I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year, and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well.   Though it presents some restrictions, I do appreciate the Bug's styling, as it sets it apart from other cars its size, "
12," This beetle is is an excellent ride for anyone who just wants to ride around. I you want a big car, then this is not for you. If you're like me, though, then you will love this car just like I do."
13," This is my favorite car that I have ever owned! I am 59 years old and love to drive this car! It is comfortable, easy to get in and out of, smooth in handling, has plenty roomy, and is just plain fun."
14," The '07 Beetle still lacks the charisma of the old Beetle.  So?  We should expect more for the more money we pay.  How about power seats (sit higher, too), locks, mirrors, a better stereo (MP4), free DVD navigation, cool electronics?  Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots.  Give it a better trunk lock.  How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top?  Give it more power.  The handling needs work.  It has a firm ride, cut the sponginess.  Hey, give it better gas mileage, please!  Also, give us attractive mirrors."
15, this is one of the best cars I have owned.  Loads of pep and manuvervability      I am downsizing our number vehicles.  Really hate to sell but  need to be practical.
16," I purchased my 2007 baby in 2010, Houston Tx and it was shipped from Florida.  Very good vehicle, performance, reliability, got caught in 2 floods water middle ways my tires and I made it through, no hesitation no problems afterwards, wonderful!  I love the air tight, heavy doors!  When shipped a lot of repairs had to be done to get it ready. But the factory warranty covered everything accept the $100 per pop!  After the factory warranty ended I purchased extended warranty that covered other repairs, but for about 1 1/2 years, because the value of my car is only $5,000, the extended warranty no longer covers, it's all on me and it has been a very expensive 2 years, seems like everything is falling apart.  And because some parts takes a long to get here, I have also paid much in rental cars. A matter of fact it's in the shop as I speak, ignition housing went out and has to be re-keyed etc., gone take 8-15 days before part arrives, go figure the cost of this rental for 15 days!  I think it may be time to move on!"
17," I previously owned a 2000 New Beetle 1.8T. That car was GREAT. It gave me very few problems, and it never left me stranded. One of the worse mistakes I have made. I've had lots of stupid problems come up. I bought the car with 68k miles, and all service records. I had no warning and the water pump went out, at 68.5k. Replaced two wheel bearings, the tie rods, the door speaker. I could go on. I have had this car a little over a year. The best part was when the inner axle snapped getting off the highway. I think my car must be a lemon. It is getting harder and harder to justify keeping it.My car looks great, but it doesn't perform half as well as my 2000 did, which had twice the miles."
18," Bought this car new from the dealer and it's given me a couple of problems but overall I don't regret the purchase. Its sole appearance makes me happy every time I look at it. I seriously love my car.My only complain is that the parts, oil changes and even the coolant are very expensive. To be objective, I have to mention that entering its 4th year (2011), little things here and there started to break down, for example the interior roof liner is coming loose on the edges, antenna broke when covered the car with an ordinary car cover and one of the windshield washers seems to be clogged. My compressor died this year too ($2000)... and the battery and the headlights but that's to be expected"
19," I love my car, especially since its paid off. But in september an ignition coil went out., Then in march 2 more went within 2 weeks of each other. Now less than 4 weeks later another one has just gone out. The only thing saving me from driving this car off a cliff, besides the repairs being covered under warranty, is the fact there is only 1 ignition coil left to go out. And VW wont replace it until it fails. I just hope it doesnt happen late at nite or when im on my way to an interview. I just dont need this aggrevation, but since I dont have a job I cant go trade this in. Hopefully the 5th coil will go out soon and I can stop worrying..."
20," Having driven a classic Beetle as a teenager, this car was a major disappointment.  Three months after buying the car, the fuel pump relay died leaving me stranded at 10:00 pm.  Three years after buying the car, I traded it in for a 2010 Honda Fit. The lights and radio wouldn't work when it was cold. The heater wouldn't work when the car was idling. The driver's headlight had to be replaced due to ""faulty wiring"". Upon acceleration or deceleration, the car would often hesitate. After a snow storm, snow would often get trapped in the wheel well causing the car to shake at speeds above 40 mph. Living in Nebraska, it's important to have a reliable car."
21," although personally i think driving is the most boring thing a person can do, i actually enjoy driving my beetle.  infact, its my second new beetle- the first one being a 2004 turbo-s.  "
22," I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since. Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring."
23," This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car! I recently sold mine since my family needs space. The car is very sturdy and well-built. I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate. I also loved the space once the back seat folds down. It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage. I never experienced mechanical problems with it. My only complaint was the oil change would cost me $70 or more. This car requires Synthetic oil, which is more expensive than regular oil. "
24," Love my Bug I get so many compliments on my car.  It is so much fun to drive and my husband who is 6' 2"" has plenty of room and is comfortable, it is my favorite car, the only improvement would be mpg, other than that the best car I have ever owned"
25," I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back. I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis.  I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3"" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive. "
26," Love the Laser Blue color.!!  This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 - 4 cylinder engine.  Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city.  The heated seats are the best new feature.!  I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well.  The comfort is great, and the room is great.  I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car.  My only other request is to make this car a hybrid.  I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control.  I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards, so this car is FAST.!  Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle.!"
27," I have owned by Beetle for 7 months and have had no problems. I love this car. At first the look impressed me the most. I finally found a 5-speed, green model which was hard to come by. The way this car handles is great. It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car. The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning! It handles in 6 inches of snow, no problem, and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better! If you are looking for a fun car with a low-maintenance feel and features then this is the car for you! "
28," I finally got my dream car: the VW Beetle.  Mine is a 2007.  I am in love!  It is very cute, and I love to drive it.  No problems yet; I am keeping my fingers crossed.  Would and do recommend to friends."
29," A car is supposed to be a reliable transportartion and reliable it is not.  Too many trips to the service department, too many recalls, too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems.  I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in. I'm charged an arm and a leg every time, without a guarantee that the fix will work.  A 10 year old KIA has had no problems.  I got too excited about aesthetics of it.  But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed.  If only I read more reviews of long-term owners.  Never another VW again.  They are nice when on the dealer lot, but in reality too much trouble."
30," This is my first foreign car and now I get it.  This car is quite impressive all around.  I love this car.  It is comfortable, enjoyable, affordable, even if the gas mileage isn't stellar.  It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city.  You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle.  It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car.  Don't over think and criticize the back seat.  It is more than enough.  So the head room isn't excessive, I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad.  Enjoy the ride."
31," Having owned another Beetle and a Jetta before this, I have come to realize that VWs on average have a shelf life of about 4 years, then it's time to trade it in!  Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner, I keep coming back over and over. Why? The handling - the driving experience. There are so few cars on the market, in my opinion, that combine compactness and great handling. Having driven other compact makes, I find that the Beetle is heavier, handles better, has better features and more road presence. While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc."
32," I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer. I was missing it terribly! Last month I bought a new 07, yellow this time. I'm so happy to have a Beetle again. It's easy to park, fun to drive, cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar, economical to keep the tank full. These are cute little cars. I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town. (It's much loved and still looks great.) I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one, it will also find the right person to love it. In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth/fabric seats. The 07 has leather, better cup holders and a much needed arm rest. Old one was manual, this one is automatic, no opinion."
33, It is well built a car.  Roomy. 150 MHP - Enough power. Easy to park. Fun to drive.
34," I am very happy to have my 4th Beetle. I have owned other cars, pick-ups and SUVs, and none compare to the overall performance, affordability, dependability and fun as my ""New Beetle"". "
35," I traded in my Red '99 for my new Sunflower yellow (GREAT COLOR) '07. Talk about a GREAT deal! Great price, and they fixed all (but 1) of the features that bothered me in my old beetle. Cup holders were moved, both seats can be raised, and  a LOT more power! that extra .5 in the engine REALLY makes a difference. SO FUN TO DRIVE!"
36," Wow. I have been a Benz and Beemer girl for many years. I wanted a change, and found it with the Beetle. While I love luxury, I like simplicity. I like speed, but not Grand Prix MPH. I want comfort, but not so much that I do not know what to do with it. I love my new Beetle. It is roomier than my former BMW 325i. The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for. The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy. BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out. VW is simple and, well, simple. The Beetle is comfy, fun, and costs much less money.  I love it!"
37," I love this car. It's awesome. I feel safe in the b\Beetle. It's quiet, it comes with an enormous amount of standard features, and for about $20,000, you can get a really decent vehicle. This is my first VW, and I've heard horrible rants about their warranty department, so hopefully everything will go smoothly, and nothing major will go wrong. I've only had the car almost a month, and as of right now, I couldn't be happier! It has a great sound system, great air conditioner, great interior, is extremely comfortable, has beautiful new head-lights, the list goes on."
38, I like this car because it is so very comfortable and very attractive.
39," I just recently traded an underpowered 2.0 5-speed manual Beetle for a 2.5 6-speed automatic Beetle.  It's even the same color.  The new vehicle has significantly more power, better ride, and better build quality.  The engine purrs at a quiet 2,200 rpm's at highway speed, making travel much more enjoyable.  It has the same great features as my '01 model.  This is a good car."
40," This was my first car at the age of 18. When I got my Beetle, it had about 72,000 miles on it, and not even 4 months after receiving it, the problems began. Immediately, my transmission died completely. My warranty company gave me a $4,000 check and voided my warranty after seeing the $12,000 repair bill. Then, the battery died. Twice. As did the alternator and air conditioning. My rear window also got stuck and that would have cost me 4 hours of labor fees just to get to the broken bits. It's not like I drove it a lot - over a course of 3 years I didn't even drive 10,000 miles. For the love of god, stay away from this car. It is one problem after another, literally every 3-5 months.Update:It has been two years since I got my new car. I have named it ""Not Beetle,"" and have had zero problems with it. Turns out the secret of German engineering is to buy a Korean car instead."
41," I bought our 2003 New Beetle Convertible Turbo with auto 6 speed in June 2003 for my wife's birthday.We had to go to Arlington, TX, to order one of the first to come into the USA.My wife has loved this car!The handling and comfort are great, and she loves to leave the pickemup drivers standing at the lights.We don't drive it much, but one highlight was trip from Huntsville, AL, to Ashville, NC, in October.But I worry a bit.There have been several service issues, including one coil recoil.The latest service, with 57,600 miles, was the appearance of Service Engine light.Dealer wants only $2200 to fix everything!"
42,"  I bought a 2003 convertible beetle with 60k. one week after driving it i notice a hard shift, a few days after an oil leak was noticed. I took it a Volkswagen dealer and they did a diagnostic and confirmed what I told them, suggested that I do a transmission fluid check and it could fix the problem I said BS. I had read all the complaints about this car and my mechanic also told me that I should have never bought it, he pointed out the the transmission could not be serviced and all of the hoses are made of plastic that with heat they become brittle and break.. so I took my loss and bought a Honda accord. don't buy this car is disposable. I would never buy a volkswagen again.."
43," 2003 Convertible, lightly driven with 43000 miles.Transmission failed, due to what now appears to be a known problem with the ""valve body"". VW support extremely poor. This car looks nice but has been nothing but trouble: windows do not work correctly, have been fixed twice, roof gets stuck and VW fitter wanted $1500 to repair (it took me 10 minutes to snap the loose clip back on and cost nothing - so much for service. Everything is a hassle to repair - battery is over $200, bulbs cannot be replaced easily, airbag light cost $250 to temporarily repair. If you want the beetle style spend the money on a restored air cooled one, from when VW knew how to make serviceable vehicles!"
44," Looking for a fun car that's sure to get people's heads turning? The Volkswagen new beetle convertible is it! This is the best car I've ever owned. It is reliable, sturdy, gets great gas mileage. I've had no problems with it. I would highly recommend this car! If you're thinking you see a bunch of bad reviews--try it for yourself, it may surprise you with how great it is. That's what I did, and it was the best choice. Good job Volkswagen!"
45," When it's all working? How fun. But most of the time something is broken. Windows, Convertible top mechanism, lights. Convertible mechanical flaps. Very expensive to fix any of it. Don't buy this car for the quality."
46," Very disappointed in the electronics of my bug - it has had so many ""bugs"".  I've had the seat belt/airbag sensors replaced, various other sensors, the catalytic converter and every time I get in it there's seems to be some dash light that comes on indicating a problem.  The car has 75,000 miles on it and is a lot of fun to drive, but I'm not recommending purchasing a Beetle because of the issues it has had.  I've written a letter to the headquarters regarding the issues along with receipts from my repairs.  Every time I take it to the dealer they want to charge $80+ for diagnostics.  I'm at the point now that I'm looking to purchase another vehicle because of the problems I've had."
47," I have spent over $8,000 trying to get my beetle to stop jerking without avail.  Now I have to spend another 6,000 to replace the transmission.  And I still owe on the car.  the beetle is a pretty car but not worth the hassle. "
48," I love this car.  I'm a BIG guy and I have all of the comfort of my Chrysler 300.  The only issue I've had is with the convertible top.  I've had it in 4 times because some cables in the raising and lowering mechanism come off track and get caught up in the whole works and it screws up the top liner.  It seems to be fixed, but now it happened to the other side and it pulled more cables loose, part of the interior molding and broke some other pieces that are down inside.  I've only had the car for 9 months and have only been putting the top down for 3 of them.  It only had 24,000 miles when I got it!  "
49," I'm upset about the repairs I've had to have done.  First the door handle, then the windows, then the convertible top, then another window.  The list goes on.  The interior is not impressive either.  The door handles' plastic coating wore through. The cigarette lighter pop out (I don't smoke) won't shut properly.  They said they just glue them shut (!).  It looks great from afar, but the quality isn't there.  But what really makes me mad is the $$ it has cost me to repair all the stuff.  Dont buy one!  No matter how fun it is to drive or how cute it looks with the top down, you might be looking at a lemon. "
50," Fell in love with this car and bought it new.  Within the first three months, I think it was in the shop about 4 times.  Since then, particularly during summer months, it's in the shop on average about once every 6 weeks.  Have had problems with the windows, the speakers, the battery (twice), the roof has broken countless times, the wiring on the tail lights, the airbag sensors, the blinker - and the door, which still isn't fixed.  Also, the service at my dealership is terrible.  They once replaced the wrong airbag so the sensor came back on a couple days later.  I would ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND this car.  They take no accountability and I will never purchase another VW, no matter how cute."
51," I bought this car used with only 20,000 miles on it.  My first car was the old VW, and ever since they came out with the new models I always wanted one.  In the 13,000 miles I have put on it in one year, I have taken it to the shop 10 times.  The manufacturers warranty has now run out (not due to mileage, but to age) and now I have to use the extended warranty I purchased from Carmax.  But they don't know how to fix VW's so I must pay extra to take it to a dealer!  (I was never informed of this!)  I have had electrical problems with the windows, top problems where it wouldn't go up or come down at times, overheating problems (3 times!), now I am finished!  I am trading in this car tomorrow! "
52, I fell in love with the New Beetle when they first came out and I have wanted one ever since.  Owning one has been a dream come true!  I love my Bug!
53," This car looks nice, rides nice, but then things start to break.  I've replaced the convertible top, driver's door, key cylinder, all the window motors, various sensors in the engine, and the convertible flaps.  So much goes wrong. I'm in a love / hate relationship with this thing. I love to drive it and I love the windshield angle / distance, but hate the constant breakdowns.  A door replacement took three weeks to fix. This car is not worth it.  Find something else."
54," The pros: Fun with top down, people love to look at it, reliable, zippy power, vinyl no dead cows to sit on, windsheild is not in your face, lots of head room. Some things that disapoint me: The stupidly short sun visor that doesnt even cover 1/4 of the window to block the sun from the side. I had to get one of those kids sun shades that suctions to the giant side window. The seats are not made for long rides or if you have any kind of back trouble. The pedals are high so if you are tall, its hard to get comfortable. I still have trouble adjusting to the seat, doesn't go back far enough. The back seat is for kids only, it has no comfort.  I like the car overall but the comfort is poor. Not it is not for old people."
55," I have to say, I love my Beetle Convertible, but I am not impressed with VW's reliability or dealer service. In less than 19,000 miles my Beetle has COMPLETELY broken down twice, and I had to have it towed both times through roadside assistance.  In fact the first one was on my way home from vacation in Florida, and the delay was not a pleasant expereience.  So far I've had the entire ignition system replaced, new battery and alternator and most recently had to have the front bumper removed just to fix a broken sensor. (A ""quick"" 6 business day fix) I think VW is right on target with their design and engineering, but they just don't make it all work.  I will not be buying another VW."
56," Never thought I'd have a VW, much less a convertible, but here I am.  This car is so cute, fun and fun to drive.  I've had the top down non-stop and have had to figure out the best way to keep my hair fixed and out of my face!  Gee, what a problem to have!  I'm 30 w/no kids and 2 dogs.  Can't wait to buy doggles for the dogs to wear in the back seat...with the wind blowing in their hair..."
57," After reading about all the problems on the New Beetle Convertible, I had to review mine.  After nearly 20,000 miles it's been flawless except for a turn signal issue that the dealer addressed.  Dealer told us to ALWAYS use the top cover or risk having the top torn away at highway speeds.  "
58, Great fun car with space for 2 adults
